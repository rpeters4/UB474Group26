    """ Input:
     Although this function doesn't have any input, you are required to load
     the MNIST data set from file 'mnist_all.mat'.

     Output:
     train_data: matrix of training set. Each row of train_data contains
       feature vector of a image
     train_label: vector of label corresponding to each image in the training
       set
     validation_data: matrix of training set. Each row of validation_data
       contains feature vector of a image
     validation_label: vector of label corresponding to each image in the
       training set
     test_data: matrix of training set. Each row of test_data contains
       feature vector of a image
     test_label: vector of label corresponding to each image in the testing
       set

     Some suggestions for preprocessing step:
     - divide the original data set to training, validation and testing set
           with corresponding labels
     - convert original data set from integer to double by using double()
           function
     - normalize the data to [0, 1]
     - feature selection"""
